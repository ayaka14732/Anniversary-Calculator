## Development

The application is built using Android Studio with Kotlin and Jetpack components. It adopts the ViewModel architecture to manage UI state and leverages coroutines together with StateFlow for reactive data updates. A repository pattern is implemented to separate data handling from the presentation layer, resulting in a codebase that is maintainable and easy to extend. Language resources are centralized to simplify localization management, with support already implemented for multiple languages and additional languages planned for future releases.
